# Introduction

As a **React** framework, **Next.js** is offers a high degree of flexibility in
organizing your project, which can sometimes make it challenging to determine
the 'best practice' or to know what approaches others are adopting.

The first decisionis whether you want a `src` forlder or not, honestly either way is fine,
you don't need to spend too thinking about this, I like having the `src` forlder
just because it has been the common practice.

Here is my suggsested strcture:

# Folder `src`

## App folder

![ocean](/static/images/app-folder.jpg)

Next Js 13 allows us to group routes under the same folder by creating
a folder using `()`. that way we can group routes using names
that make sense to uor application.

## Others folder
- **Components**: Đơn giản chỉ là nơi để bạn lưu trữ các component của mình. Có nhiều cách để cấu trúc các components trong thư mục này.
- **Configs**: Thư mục chứa các files config chung của dự án.
- **Context**: Lưu trữ các files context.
- **Enums**: Lưu chữ các biến enums, biến constant dùng chung cho dự án.
- **Hooks**: Thư mục chứa các custom hooks.
- **Server-actions**: Next JS allows us to have functions that we can call from the client components that run on the server by using the 'use server' string on top of a function. A good to organize those functions is by creating a server-actions folder.
- **Types**: Lưu trữ các types, interfaces.
- **Styles**: Lưu trữ các file css.


## Sample code block
```js
import Image from 'next/image'

function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>My Homepage</h1>
      <Image src="/me.png" alt="Picture of the author" width={500} height={500} />
      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
    </>
  )
}

export default Home
```

For a markdown file, the default image tag can be used and the default `img` tag gets replaced by the `Image` component in the build process.

Assuming we have a file called `ocean.jpg` in `data/img/ocean.jpg`, the following line of code would generate the optimized image.

```
![ocean](/static/images/ocean.jpg)
```

Alternatively, since we are using mdx, we can just use the image component directly! Note, that you would have to provide a fixed width and height. The `img` tag method parses the dimension automatically.

```js
<Image alt="ocean" src="/static/images/ocean.jpg" width={256} height={128} />
```

_Note_: If you try to save the image, it is in webp format, if your browser supports it!

# Benefits

- Smaller image size with Webp (~30% smaller than jpeg)
- Responsive images - the correct image size is served based on the user's viewport
- Lazy loading - images load as they are scrolled to the viewport
- Avoids [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/)
- Optimization on demand instead of build-time - no increase in build time!

# Limitations

- Due to the reliance on `next/image`, unless you are using an external image CDN like Cloudinary or Imgix, it is practically required to use Vercel for hosting. This is because the component acts like a serverless function that calls a highly optimized image CDN.

  If you do not want to be tied to Vercel, you can remove `imgToJsx` in `remarkPlugins` in `lib/mdx.js`. This would avoid substituting the default `img` tag.

  Alternatively, one could wait for image optimization at build time to be supported. A different library, [next-optimized-images](https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-optimized-images) does that, although it requires transforming the images through webpack which is not done here.

- Images from external links are not passed through `next/image`
- All images have to be stored in the `public` folder e.g `/static/images/ocean.jpeg`
